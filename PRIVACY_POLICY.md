Privacy Policy
===============

Last Updated: April 28, 2025

1. Introduction
----------------
Sunrise Scribe ("the App") is designed with your privacy as its highest priority. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.

2. Offline-First Design
-----------------------
• **Local-Only Storage** – All information you enter into the App is stored *exclusively* on the device where the App is installed. The data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly move or back it up yourself.

• **No Internet Requirement** – The App functions entirely offline. It does not require an internet connection to operate and will not attempt to transmit any data over a network.

3. Data Collection & Sharing
----------------------------
• **No Data Collection** – The App does **not** collect, track, or log any personal data, usage analytics, or metadata.

• **No Third-Party Sharing** – Because the App never transmits data, no information is shared with the developer, advertisers, analytics providers, or any other third parties.

4. Data Access & Control
------------------------
• **Sole Ownership** – You are the sole owner and controller of the data stored by the App.

• **Deletion & Portability** – You may delete or move your data at any time by removing or copying the local files where the App stores information. The App offers no remote backup or synchronization features, leaving all such decisions entirely in your hands.

5. Security
-----------
While the App keeps all data on your device, we encourage you to apply standard security practices—such as disk encryption, strong passwords, and regular backups—to protect your information.

6. Changes to This Policy
-------------------------
If we ever introduce features that could alter the scope of this Privacy Policy—such as optional cloud backups—we will update this document accordingly and obtain your explicit consent before any such features are enabled.
